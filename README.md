# ublock filters

uBlock does a pretty good job by default of blocking sites, I wanted to add my own list to block some that have fell through the cracks.

## Installation

click uBlock icon, go to dashboard, under custom click import, paste in the URL:

I have additionally made a separate file just for 'news' sites that post garbage content or lies (subjective, and this could technically be almost all news sites)
